# Stuff we need to know 
- We use Pug instead of html it's easier to maintain.
 - We use SCSS instead of Css for the same reason
 # YARN is our goto package manager it's amazing.
 # .gitignore is for files we are going to leave out of uploads:
 we are ignoring the node_modules because you can literally use node or yarn to download all the apps 
 dependencies with a single command which is faster than downloading it from a repo.
